My name is Mike Minutillo.

I'm a software engineer, a solution architect, a team lead, and a speaker.


I have 18 years of industry experience building custom software solutions.

Since 2015, I have worked from home in Perth Western Australia, for [Particular Software](https://particular.net).

I track my finances with a custom LINQPad script.

When I was 10 years old I wanted to be an astronaut, or a fantasy author. Then my parents purchased me my first computer. It was an Amstrad CPC 6128 (I still have it). In order to play games on it, I had to type them in from magazines.

I was hooked. Once per month, I would ride my bike to a local news agency, to grab the latest Amstrad Action magazine which had come all the way from England. I learned to code, but more importantly I learned to debug. Copying text by hand from a magazine to a machine's memory is ... lossy. 

I learned patience (a valuable skill now that I have 3 kids).

When I'm not coding, I am likely to be playing a tabletop game somewhere. I have an [extensive collection](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/codermike?gallery=large&rankobjecttype=subtype&rankobjectid=1&columns=title%7Cstatus%7Cversion%7Crating%7Cbggrating%7Cplays%7Ccomment%7Ccommands&geekranks=Board+Game+Rank&excludesubtype=boardgameexpansion&own=1&objecttype=thing&ff=1&subtype=boardgame) that may be outgrowing my shelving. My favorites at the moment are [Gloomhaven](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174430/gloomhaven), [Scythe](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/169786/scythe), and [Terraforming Mars](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/167791/terraforming-mars).

Since December 2013, I have been [tracking Kickstarter Campaigns in the Tabletop Games category](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/blog/3021) for [kickthetable.com](http://kickthetable.com).

I [track every TV show I watch](https://trakt.tv/users/codermike/history). I'll watch almost anything fantasy/sci-fi themed. I should probably do the same for movies watched, books read, and games played.
