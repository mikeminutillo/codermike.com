### RPGs

There's a few RPGs that I am interested in. Aside from ordering from Book Depository, you can pick up any of these from [Tactics](http://www.tactics.net.au/) in the city or [Quenda Games](http://www.quendagames.com.au/) in Midland. 

I'd love to get a dice tray. Something with a felt bottom that I can roll dice into :)

I am starting a D&D campaign. There's a few books that I want to get.

- Princes of the Apocalypse 
- Out of the Abyss 
- Curse of Strahd 
- Storm King's Thunder 
- Tomb of Annihilation
- Monster Cards (there are two sets, Level 1-5 and Level 6-16)
- Magic Item Cards
- Spellbook Cards (specifically the Arcane and Cleric decks)

There's a couple of Pathfinder RPG books I'd love to get

- Pathfinder Rise of the Runelords Hard Cover 
- Pathfinder Curse of the Crimson Throne Hard Cover 

There's even some FFG Star Wars RPG book I'd love to have

- Star Wars: Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook 
- Star Wars: Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook

There's a couple of indie RPG titles that I'd love to get too:

- Fiasco
- Dread

There's a hard-cover book called The Worlds of Android. Tactics is unable to get it. I don't know if there is a copy at Quenda.


### Board Game Stuff

I love board games and I maintain an active wishlist [here](https://boardgamegeek.com/wishlist/codermike). There are some titles on this list that aren't available yet. Also at Christmas each year I participate in a global Secret Santa thing which uses this wishlist. 

Here's some that I know you can pick up at Games World in Midland

- Splendor
- Clank! 
- Century: Spice Road
- Pandemic: The Cure


#### Lord of the Rings: The Card Game

These ones you'd need to check Quenda/Tactics for I think:

- The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill
- The Hobbit: On the Doorstep
- The Fellowship of the Ring: The Black Riders
- The Fellowship of the Ring: The Road Darkens
- The Two Towers: The Treason of Saruman
- The Two Towers: The Land of Shadow
- Return of the King: The Flame of the West
- Return of the King: The Mountain of Fire


### Books

#### Brandon Sanderson

This guy finished the Wheel of Time series and has become one of my favorite authors.

* Shadows of Self
* Legion: The Many Lives of Stephen Leeds
* Skyward


#### Others

* Ancilliary Justice by Ann Leckie - A warship trapped in a human body seeks revenge!
* The World of Ice and Fire - because more info about Game of Thrones until the next book comes is welcome 
* Shift by Hugh Howey - Sequel to Wool (which I thoroughly enjoyed). What if you lived in a silo underground your whole life and were told the outside was destroyed?

### Should you have won lotto and want to surprise me :)

#### Ultimate Collector Series Lego Sets

I want these and I didn't buy them when they were available and now they are ridiculously expensive. In most cases there are smaller non-UCS sets of the same thing but I really want these insanely large versions.

* [10030 Imperial Star Destroyer](http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/10030_Imperial_Star_Destroyer) - My favorite starship
* [10179 Millennium Falcon](http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/10179_Ultimate_Collector%27s_Millennium_Falcon) - I have a Millenium Falcon and it's really cool. This one is EVEN bigger
* [10221 Super Star Destroyer](http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/10221_UCS_Super_Star_Destroyer) - Darth Vaders ridiculously large flagship
* [10227 B-Wing](http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/10227_B-Wing) - One of my favorite fighters
* [10240 Red Five X-Wing](http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/10240_Red_Five_X-wing_Starfighter) - X-Wing
* [76042 The S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier](http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/76042_The_S.H.I.E.L.D._Helicarrier)
