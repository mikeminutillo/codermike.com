### Should you have won lotto and want to surprise me :)

I want these and I didn't buy them when they were available and now they are ridiculously expensive. In most cases there are smaller non-UCS sets of the same thing but I really want these insanely large versions.

* [10179 Millennium Falcon](http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/10179_Ultimate_Collector%27s_Millennium_Falcon) - I have a Millenium Falcon and it's really cool. This one is EVEN bigger
* [10221 Super Star Destroyer](http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/10221_UCS_Super_Star_Destroyer) - Darth Vaders ridiculously large flagship
* [10227 B-Wing](http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/10227_B-Wing) - One of my favorite fighters
* [10240 Red Five X-Wing](http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/10240_Red_Five_X-wing_Starfighter) - X-Wing
* [76042 The S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier](http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/76042_The_S.H.I.E.L.D._Helicarrier)
