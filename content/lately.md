I'm in [Perth, Western Australia](https://time.is/Perth) working from home for [Particular Software](https://particular.net/).


# What I'm doing now
- Preparing to [speak at NDC Sydney](/speaking)
- Teaching my kids Role Playing Games (using the awesome [Pathfinder Beginner Box](https://rpggeek.com/rpgitem/98302/pathfinder-roleplaying-game-beginner-box))
- Playing in a few tabletop campaigns
  - [**Imperial Assault**](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/164153/star-wars-imperial-assault) - almost finished Return to Hoth campaign. Playing as a Rebel and not doing well at all.
  - [**Gloomhaven**](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174430/gloomhaven) - two ongoing campaigns. One as a level 4 Spellweaver and one as a Level 2 Scoundrel. Loving this game.
  - **Dungeons and Dragons** - my first time DMing a long running campaign. Ran through the Lost Mines of Phandelver campaign from the [starter kit](https://rpggeek.com/rpgitem/161984/dungeons-dragons-starter-set) and am now transitioning the characters to [Hoard of the Dragon Queen](https://rpggeek.com/rpgitem/162997/hoard-dragon-queen).
- [Reporting weekly](https://boardgamegeek.com/blog/3021) on Kickstarter Campaigns in the Tabletop Games category for [kickthetable.com](kickthetable.com)
